# AngelHack2016
Mei is a hard coded chat bot meant as a prototype for Angel hack 2016. It's programmed using JavaScript and jQuery.

We initially wanted to create a productivity app with Mei as a pet, and whenever you do your daily habits and todos, she would continue to be happy. If you fail to keep up, she will cheer you on but grow more depressed as you continue to neglect your duties.
